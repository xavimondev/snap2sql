## Introduction

vdbs stands for **"vision database sql"** This project allows you to convert your database diagrams into SQL Schema using the capabilities of [Vision API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision). Once your SQL code is ready, you have three integration options for your Supabase projects:

1. Simply copy and paste the SQL schema into your Supabase dashboard.

2. Copy the npm command generated after your SQL schema is ready and paste it into your app. This creates a migration file containing the SQL schema.

3. Use your database connection string, and the SQL schema will be deployed to your remote Supabase project.

vdbs is inspired by [v0.dev from Vercel](https://v0.dev/), which allows you to generate UI based on images or your ideas. You can copy the code or use the npm command and integrate the generated code into your project.
